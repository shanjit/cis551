5. Why use fprintf and not fputs - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5690979/fputs-vs-fprintf


Basic idea 
==========
Two main ideas

1. Tying up a socket file descriptor with a file pointer using fdopen. 
Eg. server_request = fdopen( sockfd, "w" ); or
	server_reply = fdopen( sockfd, "r" );

2.
Write C strings to a file stream using fputs
Read C strings from a file stream using fgets

The file stream getting the input from the user is the STDIN.
The file stream printing the output to the user is the STDOUT. 

Be sure to use fflush to print out unformatted strings.
Client side 
------------
The file stream printing to the socket => server_request
The file stream reading from the socket => server_reply

Server side 
------------
The file stream printing to the socket => client
The file stream reading from the socket => client


Client side
===========
//
//
// Anything sent to the server is server_request
// Anything got from the server is the server_reply
//
//

Input
-----
Read from the STDIN (file stream) into the buffer send_buf using fgets. 
Write the send_buf (C string) to the server_request (file stream) using fputs. 
fflush(server_request) to send it to the server

Output
------
Read from the server_reply (file stream) into the buffer recv_buf using fgets.
Write the recv_buf (C string) to the STDOUT (user screen) using fprintf. (why not fputs ? See prereading)


Server side
===========
//
// Anything sent to the client is the client_reply
// Anything got from the client is the client_request
//

Service Input from Client
-------------------------
1. fgets the client_request (file stream) into a buffer. fgets( buf, BUFSIZE, client_request)

2. Use sscanf to take out the string from the buf using a pointer pointed by find_comma, find_equals or find_dollar. This is to find out if he wants to send username, password or add/delete a new username password.

3. Using <name,user> to add or <name$user> to delete.

4. Make a return string and put the string into the file stream client_reply. fflush the stream. 

Send data back to the client
----------------------------
fputs the string into the client_reply file stream and then fflush.
