Things to remember:

	1.) Builtins can easily be redirected. Just look at the proper
IoCmd[] entry, e.g. IoCmd[0] for stdin, to see if it has some new value.
This can then be used to put out the builtin's output to the right file.

	2.) Arguments to builtins are just as easy if they're all picked up
in the normal parsing sweep. File Name Generation will be done automagically.

	3.) The only place where files might be instantiated multiple
times and *matter* (is this true?) is when multiple outputs are created.
For normal (non device special) files, this might take the form:
cat - >foo1 >foo2 >foo3 >>foo4
In this case, foo[1-3] are opened and created, and closed, and foo4 
is appended to as the standard output file for cat.


Also: HERE documents must be gotten right.


&2 doesn't work right. How do we deal with leading "."? Is there an
easy charcater oriented test. Directory stack looks like
a kludge to get aroung having get_dir_match() return all the matches
as an object. May also add a lot of overhead.

Note that we should only sort in expand(), after all of the matches
have been generated.


Have to clean up Sys V dup2(); doesn't seem to work well.
May be cause of 2>&1 failure to redirect 2; test on Ultrix.

Good_dir() should check access permissions; bad things happen
if directories to be expanded cannot be read (e.g. core dumps)

There's a bug in HERE document creation; the creation can't be done
until the parse of the line is over (rather than botched, as it is now)
since with:

	cat <<HERE >bar

>bar will be sucked up as part of the HERE document input. bletch.
